KIX
===

This project is built in a language called Silver, which is an
attribute grammar specification language.

More information about Silver can be found here:
http://code.google.com/p/silver/

The point of this project is to experiment with adding
quasi-automatic documentation to kix using the tools provided
by Silver.

We are also using this space to extend kix and add more
functionality to it.
