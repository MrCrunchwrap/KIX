KIX
===

This project is built in a language called Silver.

Silver is a programming language that is being developed to 
investigate highly-modular, extensible, attribute grammar-based 
language specifications. In other words, Silver is a programming 
language for implementing programming languages, with a focus on 
making those languages extensible.

More information about Silver can be found here:
http://code.google.com/p/silver/

The point of this project is to experiment with adding
quasi-automatic documentation to kix using the tools provided
by Silver.

We are also using this space to extend kix and add more
functionality to it.
